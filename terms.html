                    These Terms will be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the law of the State of Texas

                    If any provision of these Terms is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unenforceable,
                    such provision will be deleted and re-interpreted to the extent necessary to comply with law and
                    interpreted and substituted to accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
